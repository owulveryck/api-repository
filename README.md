# Abstract

Web Oriented API is a must for a company that wants to interact with the outside world.
Most of the companies tend to develop an API as an entry point to their platform. On top of that, data is in the center of the strategies; therefore grabbing data through API is also fundamental.
The *availability* of the API is more than ever a concept that can cause severe business loss if not handled properly.

As an SRE, part of a product team, I expose what I expect from an API in term of objectives to manage and pilot the reliability of the application.

Then I use those objectives to design and develop an underlying API that can handle a bulk of product to store them in a DAO.

In the end, I give some pointers to host this "_cloud-native_" application on the cloud in a cost-effective way (using GCP app engine).


## Takeway

Unit Tests are fundamental for developing software in quality. Thinking with objectives is a must to think about reliability from the design of the application.
